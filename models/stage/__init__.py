# Hold data about the current stage/page the program is on

# Saving, loading, main menu, game menu, the actual game,

# In space, on planet, etc...

# Perhaps there could also be a segmentation for what the action that
#   the player is currently engaged in on screen, eg fight, build, etc.
#   and change program performance depending on this.
